# What is it?
This is a work-in-progress open format for song charts - the data required to capture instrument performances that make up a song.

# What is it not?
 - It is not a score format. It is designed to represent a song as actually performed, with events synchronized to an audio recording.
 - It is not an "editor" format. It is designed for playback.

# What is in this repo?
